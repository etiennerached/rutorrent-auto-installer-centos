rutorrent-auto-installer-centos
===============================

ruTorrent Auto Installer Script for CentOS and Debian/Ubuntu

This auto installer was initially found in here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/autodl-irssi/files/autodl-setup/download

However it's no longer updated by it's original author, and most of the SVNs were outdated which broke the installation.
So I decided to fix the urls and add it in here.

How to run and install instructions:
